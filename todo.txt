blockarray number 
validatie dat jij netzoveel of dezelfde max hebt nee eigenlijkniet want dan is je probationem toch anders dus toch wel


-1 bvalidatie niet alleen in de tx sync maar ook in de block sync

dus na blockchain is eerst mamap na cryptorates updaten na presalediscount is het tijd fvoor govermentchain en dan dickpictur.es


maby we should require a hash of this program in the incipio block so you can not adjust this program


the seceret is nessesary in bootnode

if you try to hack my blockchain we could make all money of the public key vanish
even though you got be alarmed so no because even if you can before you try to hack becaus eyou know send all your money to public key and then we would have to make vanish all money you have ever sended
what we can do instead is we can put you on the blacklist which means you have to sync from block 0 again as punishment for trying to hack our blockchain


for now just remove one block the one that is invalid because of validation upon syncing


validation the max blocknumber for the array should be defined in the incipio block

threads still increase to two eventhough the loop is off also something todo


so the expressitransactions array reserves the transaction for being reproduced but it should only count if the next block is an expressi block


you dont buy defensio or attack with sending money to blockhash because otherwise you would own both defensioinde and attack with sending money to blockchash
which maby should stay because it is more attractive to own both with one bid because of inflation i mean deflation
 

so i need to build app if make sense to overbid who overbid your defense and attack because ja sometimes you can not win


it is easier to attack as fdifferent hexa decimal you know 1 which are 2 letters than to keep defensio also attack i mean if defensio would be attack to at sametime


find out wtf happens if you lose or get defeaten while you are fucking rich which means you own the defensio because you bid with your public key 
on this defensio so the answer actually is i already know you submit the same public key to be accepeted for liber money
but your whole team will benefit of this defensio or in the future ofcourse attack too


did i already write that the threads you know should go back to zero if the loop is not on and you mined a block otherwise the thread calculator goes to 2 which i do not want grrr


check if confussus or expressi let enter new keypairs



private public keys so you dont know which publlic key is strong

and in gladiator route i would like to find strongest gladiator or weakest an d the defences they own eemight me all sepereate route now while we can combine thjis time


chgeck if index of invicos is correct in side of gladiatoras block


if is still in pool or block you should not be able to submit in pool and block the same public key to accept liber money



why in the fuck sakew name or kk we huse liber inside of the defensiones function to find all defensionens oh i know maby you can also buy defensiones with fixum money


in this new gladiatir roure to get gthe base dl
efense and the bought defenses i would  also ike to tell the highest bid on this defensio

have a endpoint to know is your gladiator isprimis or not
 

so we have found out all team gladiator loses but to they all lose their money i mean burn



als o validate if the probationem contains the defences or defences minus attacks for the two blocks


als node niet connect trough socket proabably with try catch we have to remove this node of this list of nodesor in otherwords bases
and ofcourse find more nodes



after reached highest block if reaches highest block thisstrategy i want to go to another random socket in your list to see if oyu can sync more

and aftetr 3 times maby send a message done syncing


ilts more important for when a new block is mined to sync to the nodes that ar 5 or 10 or whatever blocks behind


to do you know the sync function wich will be a flag ypou dont nessesary have to use if you reached the highest block of the random node
i would like to send you a message in a different peer to peer message that you have synced as far as you could and you now
have to wait on a new obstructionum


salvare inside of issalvarepervideasmesssage was important but i can not remember now


transactions in the pool should only be able to be removed out of the pool is they are included in a block
somehow we can read the tx hash and see if any of the blocks contains  this tx

naast de transaction isperobationem we alspo have to implement the gladiator is probationem and maby even for them both i dont think a previous probationem
which sounds unnsessary because of the priorprobationem to the prior block


the owner of a transaction aka the new output created has a boolean for ever being arrived
somehow wen you send money to a public key
we have to do something so that the reciever can do something press the button if he did not recieve this transaction with this transaction id
but what if the sender of this tx does not have enough pod maby we should have some insurance pod that comes out of nothing which would make our blockchain
hackable but you can invest in this insurance pot of pod



wait is all bullcrap you can not remove transaction from pool unless transaction is included in a block yes the other nodes validate this
so the above is just stupid but i like for proof off scotch some kind a insurance you can invest in instead of this gladiator battle to have some other
validation of the real chain

one problem if they somehow remove a tx from the pool will it still mine to enough leading zeros to ever be included
can we somehow mine tx on other nodes too? no that would be weird
but somehow we can notice that the zeros arent increasing so a solution
is somehow sometimes a block on adding to the pool untill the pool is empty 
i mean included in blocks and then you can submit your transaction again


echt belangewrijk defensios en attacks bewijzen in zowel confussus als expressi in par ad rimnor


voor het door minen van transactions and accounts juist have the nonce as an array and each node will keep on mining



we have to do more validation inside of conva for expressi only but lets start with the block maby we already have

all we need to do for expressi and confussus maby is check if the defensios minus the attacks are in the probationem


uhmmm a signature can not sign a signature a signature has to reference some thing else than something containing this signature

in case of transform the function to validate the signature will throw an error because the gladiator that defeats you has the right on this signature



wil ik wel weten deze public key ik wil weten de defences van de verliezer en de attacks van de winner

naast het valideren van de transforme moeten wij misschien eerst valideren dat het hele 
team dat verslagen is al ze money burnt naar de blockchash van het vorige block


alleen de producentis zijn geld wordt fixum de rest blijft gewoon liber team 



some how the remover of this block can prevent all transactions being in the priority tx pool
so how about a storage of hashes for incase a block gets removed and all transactions as so
or leave it all because could he prevent this hash to no not if these are in the pool forever or written in the previous block
how can i store a hash of a new block in a previous block nee dat kan niet
wat als ik in het volgende blok de hash bewaar van de vorige transacties daar heb je niks again
als ze voor altijd inde poolzwemmen wordt de pooloverbelast of dit is een 2e chain met alleen hashes van fixum en liber txs

a way to proof that you removed the block but indeed gave the transactions of that pool to the prioritypool
you could first ask the network which you can avoid
still you would need more mining power than the whole network to remove a block and replace it 
shall i keep the risk of never being certain the money is yours or somehow certain still but in the beginning
with to less nodes this is tricky
aha i have an idea
if you submit a tx a hash of it is stored and for each block we validate of all these hashes are in the chain not quite yet

also important is ,,aby for every tx that you spend more then you have payed on defences to prevent something 
ofcourse if you lost a block wait its hard ithink to remove and win if you are alone depends on your mining rig


maby a certain passphrase is given after you request to remove a block so that all nodes have the txs of this block

or back to plan b

just like the blockreward is infinite like the length of the chain
as soon as you submit a tx you get a certain proof that if it dissapears out of the chain you only have to give this proof
still someone is winning
nee ik kan niet klaar zijn numbersaboteurs and clever will use this imagine ethereum squad making is go backk to incipio with their mining power
nja hmmm weet niet misschien toch wel klaar nee na een tijdje kan je echt niet meer deze divisa division beaten echt niet
maar ja ik zou pas hmmmmm na 20 blockken ofzo zeker zijn or they both continue nee this is ilovet blockchain sorry yes they are working too

okey they both continue for while and then you must have a winner they win too  quick hmmmm or is perfect like this im tired
or your ahah this jaaa

your tx stays in pool untill 20 blocks yes every tx gets in priority pool from the point of submit
and when do they leave welll after a certain amount of blocks depends with all these hmm what i have to think of my habbo game take your opponent
yeasha ists me iscool77 but ya oke en nu no ilovet i dont wnat to build your blockchain oke but

the chains keep on groing both and you as a chain can get stuck and no longer grow


okey thats your chain


my chain is just proof ja but their was a winner and loser with this proof you get from the transaction once tyou submit
alright who is the loser and who is the winner
the winner is maby the shop but thentheir must be certain rules to be shop certain rules to be able to accept money
so that you can not be a winner
yes you need to have an amount of money to ever be able to accept money otherwise you cant because you could empty yourr public key
or we leave the amount and we track down all money that the shop send his money to and than i have head ic wait
who is the winner?
who is the loser?
ohhhhh the loser is the shop yes he recieved money and the block got removed by a customer
(another reason to leave this as it is because shops wont but oke)
then the shop needs to have proof
yes the reciever of money needs to have some kind a proof
and the sender of money can win somehow with a brand new public key only deposit on this key when he wants to buy something and then removes the blcok and starts mining
this could be an entire squad working together with all their mining power
so somehow the rule of having more money on your tx must be more money than you have spend on attacks and blockhashes
otherwise you can not send money
i got it i got it lets dance
still confused more or less money huh that wont take a long time to figure out noah
more right or less
oke so you can buy attacks and you can buy defences the heighest bid on a defence wins and owns untill gets overbidden then he does not get his money back
so once you spend money on defence you are addicted to spending money on this particular defence
okey 
so we count all the money you have spend on blockhashes /defences/attacks yes as a sender of money only
and then you already now this answer while i am stupid if you see this

oke imagine more

inbetween the point is you dont want to throw this public key away because of all your defences and attacks you have bought to this public key
even if your team gets defeaten they all burn their money to the previous block their hash or defences and attacks
so your public key yes i know is more but why i dont get yet no the answer is less yess oh so stupid
ofcourse why quick
because of 0 amount of money on your publickey

oke imageine alice wants to buy a bread for 5 pod 


you can only pay or send less money than your total amount of burned money to defences and attacks this is the answer
because if a block removed still the reviever has some proof but you must always still pay instead of infinity pod for reciever
its about you not wanting a new public key you always would need to stick to your public key yes for your own benefit
so thats why if it is less money you spend then you have bought you would not like to throw this public key away
son that this proof of the reciever can never recieve his or hers money

what i do wann right own is that the shop must have the entire transaction as a proof so as a reciever of money you always
store this specific transaction on your local db how about priority in the priority pool you just continue mining on the 
nonce that everr was included

nooo 
you need to obtain a way of signing money that you owe of the different public key that had sended tyou


somehow the reciever of pod has to be able to sign with his private key the same amount of money when he can proof his transaction is not in one of the blocks

oke imagine less 

how do we give shops this proof i could do some blockreading but the sender of the money recieves the identitatis
which could be used as proof
if it is a distance transaction how do we prooof the shop owner has recieved the proof

the shop owner has to submit this proof with signing what to sign


transactions can only be grabbed if this proof is submitted by the shop owner
so that means the public key

the tx should only start mining after the 4 scan

or how does the shop find the tx if it aint in the pool

should we have a seperate array to keep it easier
or should we sign inside of the transaction 4 times

can i have seperate array for these signs or does the tx have to contain these signatures


or i have to avoid starting to mine but still in the pool or a seperate class i think both can work

no a seperate class can not work because these will be removed too if the block gets removed


it is important that after the divisa was smaller and the tot difficclty was higher we somehow stop est-furca or change it to false again or throw error upon still furca set to true after defeating

the sirationem the assurance of a tx needs tpo hacve inputs and outputs
first the whole sirationem should be included in a block as output ofcourse
and then whenever this sirationem in a block can take the money of the one in debth we have to create an input to disable this output 


what if the block with the assurance tx gets removed than he just has toppo resubmit his identitatis which aint found




so your impetums are being used against you whilethey should not





lof was only block number 5 
blcok 3 and 4 are missingin lou it jumps from 2 to five but lof is reversed will lof be a list instead of just one 

its weird that foramenfurca grabs number 5 too 
eventhough it searching for a probationem of the previous block number 5 ort somethign

somehow i believe block number 5 has a probationem as its priorprobationem now is this correct

how can it grab 5 if we use the priorprobationem of 5

the prior aint the pro so how

or how did block number 5 got in the foramenfurca and 4 did not while 4 was the efectus and 5 the confussus

we can restart and quit at the first fork

or hmm






okey estvurum changed the last block to numerus 5 instead of 4


ik fork tot en met 6 moet 1 fton hebben maar 7 moet 2 fton hebben 

check removereusquad if the highest number pof the array is reached


probatur probably goes to false if it finds another leadingzero

and liber of siremotiones should be part of the output



we could not proof that probatur went to false because of another leading zero but now we have found evidence


again txs should mine on the other node too instead only on the node you submit to


heel raar maar al onze remove functies voor het weghalen van txs of propter of siremotionem kunnen de should be deleted value bewaren als 
miss een extra nul wordt gevonden op dezelfde tijd van het block


maby it is better to have 2 attacks and 1 defence in a block to always be able of mining a block


if this poolusertest works we have to test straightaway what if their are multiple outputs in a tx in the stagnum


je valt in je  eentje iets van 100 public keys aan die allemaal defences hebben gekocht dus hoeveel attacks zou je moeten krijgen als je geld stuurt naar een blockhash
maar wacht kun je al je wapens van je team gebruiken?


payment accounts
we need payment accounts that can only send money to one address or public key
if this public key get defeated we want to burn all money on the payment accounts too
so that we do not have to send this money automatic to this key but the owner can keep it their or send it through if it wants to accept another payment


we have forgotten about why capta is nessesary just forget about sumo and remove also were capta is true


if the fissile paymnt account referes a payment account could it bypass a limit and should we disable payments accounts to b a reciver of a payment acc


expressi block miner should throw error if the block is not mined on top of an efectus
